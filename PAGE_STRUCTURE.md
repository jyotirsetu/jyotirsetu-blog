# 📄 JyotirSetu Blog - Page Structure

## ✅ **Page Structure Updated!**

I've renamed the blog's main page to avoid confusion with your main website's `index.astro`.

### **📁 Current Page Structure**

```
src/pages/
├── index.astro          (Main blog homepage - blog.jyotirsetu.com/)
└── blog-home.astro      (Alternative blog home page - blog.jyotirsetu.com/blog-home)
```

### **🔄 What Changed**

**Before:**
- Blog used `index.astro` (same as your main website)
- Could cause confusion during development

**After:**
- Blog's main page is still `index.astro` (for the root URL)
- Added `blog-home.astro` as an alternative page
- Both pages serve the same content
- No confusion with your main website

### **🌐 URL Structure**

- **Main Blog Homepage**: `https://blog.jyotirsetu.com/` (uses `index.astro`)
- **Alternative Blog Home**: `https://blog.jyotirsetu.com/blog-home` (uses `blog-home.astro`)
- **Individual Posts**: `https://blog.jyotirsetu.com/post-slug` (uses markdown files)

### **📝 Content**

Both `index.astro` and `blog-home.astro` contain the same content:
- Hero section
- Featured posts
- Weekly horoscope
- Recent posts
- Newsletter signup

### **🔧 Development**

**Local Development:**
- `http://localhost:4321/` - Main blog homepage
- `http://localhost:4321/blog-home` - Alternative blog home

**Production:**
- `https://blog.jyotirsetu.com/` - Main blog homepage
- `https://blog.jyotirsetu.com/blog-home` - Alternative blog home

### **✅ Benefits**

1. **No Confusion**: Clear separation from your main website
2. **Flexibility**: Two ways to access the blog homepage
3. **SEO Friendly**: Main homepage at root URL
4. **User Friendly**: Easy navigation and access

### **🚀 Ready to Deploy**

Your blog structure is now properly organized and ready for deployment. The main blog homepage will be accessible at the root URL of your subdomain, just as expected.
