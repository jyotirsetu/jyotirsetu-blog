        Diwali, the Festival of Lights, is a time of joy, family, and new beginnings. Astrologically, Diwali marks a time when many people set intentions for prosperity and inner growth, making it a powerful period for spiritual and material abundance.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Why Diwali is Important</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Diwali is not just a festival of lights; it's a cosmic celebration that marks the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. From an astrological perspective, this festival occurs during a time when the planetary energies are particularly supportive of new beginnings and positive transformations.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The festival's timing is carefully chosen to align with favorable planetary positions, making it an auspicious time for starting new ventures, making important decisions, and setting intentions for the coming year.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Diwali and Planetary Significance</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        From an astrological point of view, Diwali evenings are considered powerful for new starts because the planetary energy supports renewal and positive change. The festival typically occurs during the new moon phase, which is associated with new beginnings and fresh starts.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        During Diwali 2023, the planetary positions create a favorable environment for:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Financial planning and wealth accumulation</li>
        <li>Spiritual growth and inner transformation</li>
