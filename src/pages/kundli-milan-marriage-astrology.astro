        In India, marriage often brings together two families, traditions, and life goals. Kundli Milan — or horoscope matching — helps families see if two people are likely to harmonize and build a successful life together.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Introduction: Marriage in Indian Culture</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Marriage in India is not just a union of two individuals but a coming together of two families, their values, traditions, and aspirations. It's a sacred bond that's meant to last a lifetime, which is why families take great care in ensuring compatibility through various means, including Kundli Milan.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The practice of horoscope matching has been an integral part of Indian marriage traditions for centuries, helping couples understand their compatibility and potential challenges before entering into this lifelong commitment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">What is Kundli Milan?</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Kundli Milan is the process of comparing two birth charts to assess compatibility between potential marriage partners. The classical method uses 36 Gunas (qualities) to evaluate various aspects of compatibility. Each match is scored; a higher score suggests smoother compatibility and better prospects for a harmonious marriage.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        However, it's important to understand that a lower Guna score does not mean a relationship will fail — it simply indicates areas that may need more attention and understanding between the partners.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">The 36 Gunas and Their Meaning</h2>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578662996442-48f60103fc96?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80"
          alt="Horoscope chart and Kundli matching analysis"
          class="w-full h-48 md:h-64 object-cover rounded-lg shadow-md"
        />
      </div>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The 36 Gunas are divided into eight categories, each carrying different weights and significance:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Varna (4 points):</strong> Spiritual compatibility and life goals</li>
        <li><strong>Vashya (2 points):</strong> Mutual attraction and control</li>
        <li><strong>Tara (3 points):</strong> Health and longevity compatibility</li>
        <li><strong>Yoni (4 points):</strong> Sexual compatibility and intimacy</li>
        <li><strong>Graha Maitri (5 points):</strong> Mental compatibility and friendship</li>
        <li><strong>Gana (6 points):</strong> Temperament and nature compatibility</li>
        <li><strong>Bhakoot (7 points):</strong> Love and affection between partners</li>
        <li><strong>Nadi (8 points):</strong> Health and progeny compatibility</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        A score of 18 or above is generally considered good, while 24+ is considered excellent for marriage compatibility.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Doshas in Matchmaking</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Mangal Dosha (Mars Dosha)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Mangal Dosha occurs when Mars is placed in certain houses in the birth chart. While it's often associated with challenges in marriage, it's not necessarily a deal-breaker. Many successful marriages have partners with Mangal Dosha, and there are effective remedies available.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Nadi Dosha</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Nadi Dosha is considered when both partners have the same Nadi (Aadi, Madhya, or Antya). This is believed to affect health and progeny. However, modern astrologers often provide remedies and solutions to mitigate its effects.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        These doshas sound serious but are manageable. An experienced astrologer will explain the nature of a dosha and suggest practical remedies — from simple rituals to behavioral advice and lifestyle adjustments.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Relevance in Delhi, UP, Haryana Families</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        In regions like Delhi-NCR, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana, many families still value Kundli Milan because it provides a framework for conversations about values, timing, and expectations. It helps families understand each other's backgrounds and approach to life.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The practice is particularly strong in these regions due to cultural traditions and the belief that astrological compatibility can help predict and prevent potential marital issues. Many families consider it an essential step before finalizing any marriage proposal.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Modern Approach to Kundli Milan</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Modern couples often balance Kundli insights with personal compatibility, communication, and mutual respect. While astrology provides valuable guidance, it should complement rather than replace personal judgment and emotional connection.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Today's approach to Kundli Milan is more flexible and understanding. Astrologers focus on providing guidance rather than rigid rules, helping couples understand their compatibility while respecting their personal choices and modern values.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Astrology's role is to provide clarity, not to dictate fate. With guidance from JyotirSetu Astrology, Kundli Milan becomes a thoughtful tool to begin married life with understanding and support. It helps couples prepare for their journey together while respecting both traditional wisdom and modern perspectives.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
        Remember, the best marriages are built on love, understanding, communication, and mutual respect. Kundli Milan is just one tool among many that can help you make an informed decision about your life partner.
