        Shani Sade Sati is one of the most discussed periods in Vedic Astrology. It refers to the seven-and-a-half-year transit of Saturn across your Moon sign. Many people fear it, but the truth is Shani brings discipline, lessons, and long-term growth rather than just difficulties.

        Shani Sade Sati, also known as Saturn's seven-and-a-half-year period, is a significant astrological phase that affects everyone at some point in their life. The term "Sade Sati" literally means "seven and a half" in Hindi, referring to the duration of this transit.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        This period occurs when Saturn transits through the 12th, 1st, and 2nd houses from your Moon sign. While often feared, this period is actually a time of karmic lessons, spiritual growth, and character building.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Three Phases Explained Simply</h2>
      
      <div class="my-8">

      </div>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The three phases — rising, peak, and setting — affect life in different ways. In the rising phase, challenges often appear in family or finances. The peak phase tests patience, and the final phase brings closure and maturity.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Phase 1: Rising (12th House)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        This initial phase lasts about 2.5 years and often brings challenges related to health, expenses, or spiritual growth. It's a time of preparation and letting go of unnecessary attachments.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Phase 2: Peak (1st House)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The most intense phase lasting 2.5 years, where Saturn directly influences your personality and life direction. This is when the real lessons and transformations occur.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Phase 3: Setting (2nd House)</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The final 2.5 years focus on wealth, family, and speech. This phase brings the fruits of your efforts and lessons learned during the previous phases.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Impact on Career, Health, and Relationships</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        <strong>Career Impact:</strong> Professional growth may slow down, but this is often a time to reassess goals and build a stronger foundation for future success.

        <strong>Health Considerations:</strong> Pay extra attention to your health, especially bones, joints, and chronic conditions. Regular exercise and a balanced diet become crucial.
