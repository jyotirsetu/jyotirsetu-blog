        Vedic Astrology, also known as Jyotish Shastra, is one of the world's oldest systems of wisdom. It originated in India thousands of years ago and remains a trusted guide for many when making life choices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Introduction to Vedic Astrology</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Vedic Astrology studies the positions of the planets, Moon, Sun, and fixed stars at the time of a person's birth. This birth chart, called a kundli, helps an astrologer read patterns about career, relationships, health, and spiritual growth.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Unlike Western astrology that gives emphasis to the Sun sign, Vedic Astrology places special importance on the Moon sign and nakshatras (constellations). This makes readings more focused on emotional patterns and timing. The main building blocks are the nine planets (Navagrahas), twelve zodiac signs, and twelve houses — each house represents a life area such as family, career, money, and marriage.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">History and Roots in India</h2>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507003211169-0a1dd7228f2d?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80"

      </div>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Vedic Astrology has its roots deeply embedded in ancient Indian scriptures, particularly the Vedas. The system has been refined over thousands of years, with contributions from great sages and scholars who observed celestial patterns and their effects on human life.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The knowledge was passed down through generations, maintaining its authenticity and spiritual significance. Today, it continues to be a vital part of Indian culture, influencing major life decisions and daily practices.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Difference between Vedic and Western Astrology</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        While both systems study planetary positions, Vedic Astrology uses the sidereal zodiac, which accounts for the precession of the equinoxes. This creates a difference of about 23 degrees between Vedic and Western charts, often placing people in different zodiac signs.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Vedic Astrology also emphasizes the Moon sign over the Sun sign, focuses more on spiritual growth and karma, and includes unique elements like nakshatras and dasha systems that provide deeper insights into life timing.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Importance of Planets, Houses, and Nakshatras</h2>
      
      <div class="my-8">
        <img
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1446776877081-d282a0f896e2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80"

      </div>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The nine planets (Navagrahas) in Vedic Astrology each govern specific aspects of life. The Sun represents the soul and father, Moon governs emotions and mother, Mars controls energy and courage, Mercury rules communication, Jupiter brings wisdom and growth, Venus influences love and beauty, Saturn teaches discipline, Rahu and Ketu provide spiritual lessons.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The twelve houses represent different life areas: 1st house (personality), 2nd house (wealth), 3rd house (siblings), 4th house (home), 5th house (children), 6th house (health), 7th house (marriage), 8th house (transformation), 9th house (spirituality), 10th house (career), 11th house (gains), and 12th house (liberation).
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Nakshatras, or lunar mansions, add another layer of depth. These 27 constellations provide insights into personality traits, life purpose, and timing of events, making Vedic Astrology incredibly precise and personalized.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Why People Still Trust Jyotish</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        People in India often turn to Jyotish for meaningful guidance: deciding a marriage match, choosing a muhurat (auspicious time) for important events, understanding career ups and downs, or finding remedies for health concerns. The system has proven its accuracy over centuries, helping millions make informed decisions.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        The practical approach of Vedic Astrology, combined with its spiritual foundation, makes it relevant even in modern times. It provides a framework for understanding life's challenges and opportunities, offering hope and direction when needed most.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Benefits of Consulting an Astrologer</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        An experienced astrologer interprets the kundli with care, suggesting realistic remedies and small lifestyle changes rather than fear-based predictions. They help you understand your strengths, challenges, and the best times to take action.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Professional guidance can help you make better decisions about career, relationships, health, and spiritual growth. It provides clarity during confusing times and helps you align with your true purpose.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        At JyotirSetu Astrology, our approach is practical and compassionate. We use Vedic principles to help you understand choices, prepare for possibilities, and align with positive timing. If you're new to astrology, start with your birth details (date, time, place) and get a simple kundli read — it's often the first step to clearer decisions.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
        Vedic Astrology is not about predicting the future but about understanding yourself better and making informed choices. It's a tool for self-discovery, growth, and living in harmony with the cosmic energies that surround us.
