      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
        Palmistry, also known as chiromancy, is an ancient art that has been practiced for thousands of years across different cultures. By reading the lines, shapes, and features of your hands, you can gain profound insights into your personality, life path, and future possibilities.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Understanding the Basics of Palmistry</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Palmistry is based on the belief that your hands are a map of your life. Every line, mount, and feature tells a story about your character, experiences, and potential. The practice involves analyzing both the shape of your hands and the lines that traverse them.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">The Major Lines in Your Palm</h2>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">1. The Life Line</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The life line curves around the base of your thumb and indicates your vitality, energy levels, and major life changes. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't predict the length of your life, but rather your quality of life and health patterns.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">2. The Head Line</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The head line runs horizontally across your palm and reveals your intellectual abilities, thinking patterns, and communication style. A long, straight line suggests logical thinking, while a curved line indicates creativity and intuition.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">3. The Heart Line</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The heart line runs horizontally across the top of your palm and represents your emotional nature, relationships, and how you express love. It can reveal your approach to relationships and emotional well-being.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">4. The Fate Line</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The fate line runs vertically up the center of your palm and indicates your career path, life purpose, and how external circumstances affect your life. Not everyone has a fate line, and its presence or absence tells its own story.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Hand Shapes and Their Meanings</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Your hand shape also provides valuable insights into your personality. Earth hands are practical and grounded, Air hands are intellectual and communicative, Fire hands are energetic and passionate, and Water hands are intuitive and emotional.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Getting a Professional Palm Reading</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        While you can learn the basics of palmistry, a professional palm reader can provide deeper insights by combining palm reading with other divination methods and years of experience. They can help you understand the subtle nuances and complex interactions between different lines and features.
