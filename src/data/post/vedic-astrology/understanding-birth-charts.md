Your moon sign represents your emotional nature and inner self. It's often more important than your sun sign in Vedic astrology.

### **Step 3: Check Planetary Positions**
Note which planets are in which houses and signs. This reveals how different life areas are influenced.

### **Step 4: Analyze Planetary Aspects**
Look at the angular relationships between planets to understand how they interact and influence each other.

### **Step 5: Consider Nakshatras**
Each planet is also placed in a specific Nakshatra (lunar mansion), which provides additional insights into its influence.
