Planetary transits are one of the most dynamic aspects of Vedic astrology, showing how the current positions of planets influence your life on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Understanding these transits can help you navigate life's challenges and opportunities with greater awareness and wisdom.

## What Are Planetary Transits?

Planetary transits refer to the current positions of planets as they move through the zodiac and interact with the planets in your birth chart. While your birth chart shows your potential and inherent nature, transits reveal the timing of when different aspects of your life will be activated or challenged.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Transit Planets**: Currently moving planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu)
